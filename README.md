# Toothpaste Squeezer
The Toothpaste Squeezer is an inexpensive 3D-printed device that aids the removal of toothpaste. This device may benefit those with limited hand dexterity or those who find it challenging to get the last bit of toothpaste out of the tube.

This design was created by [Spidersky1489](https://www.printables.com/social/54495-spidersky1489/about) and posted on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/26897-toothpaste-squeezer/files).
